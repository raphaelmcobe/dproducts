### IMDB movie Navigator

This application uses the imdb dataset available at the ggplot2 dataset.

Dataset is also available at the maintainer website [Movies Dataset](http://had.co.nz/data/movies/) and processed as a part of peer assignment for the course.

Source code is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/raphaelmcobe/dproducts).

You can adjust date range and movies genres using control panel located on the left side.
The app then adjusts the charts accoringly:

1. The first tab shows the movies budget distrubuted over the years.
2. The second tab shows the number of movies distrubuted over the years
3. The third tab compares the budget (average) with the movies rating (average) distrubuted over the years
